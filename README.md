# QuickHeal
[PLUGIN] Heals a player upon tapping an item on the ground.  Extra support for Mushroom + Beetroot Stew.  All editable in a config.

Config options:
- Item ID
- Health restored upon tap
- Name (coming in MCPE v0.12)
- Enchant (coming in MCPE v0.12)

You can create an infinite amount of items that heal you any amount!  If you set the Item ID to a certain food and Health Gained to 0, that would make it so that specific food wouldn't heal you any health (no work-arounds, either!).

In the future, I plan on adding support for:
- Custom food heal (if it's real food, choose between tap and eat + the amount of health gained)
- Items give you effects
- So much more!

Please direct any questions, concerns, suggestions, or requests to @Sean_MCPE on Twitter.
